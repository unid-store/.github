<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

UDS is a project aimed at creating a super simple, decentralized, and secure way to share files. We're building on top of web3 technologies to allow users to share files with just a click, eliminating the complexities often associated with onboarding and use of decentralized technologies.

File sharing is a well-known issue. People have been sharing files even before the internet, through BBS. Today, if you Google "Simple file sharing", you'll find tons of web2 services. However, what you really need is a decentralized and secure p2p way to share files! That's where UDS comes in.

Our goal is to launch a simple file exchange service built on top of web3 that would allow users to share files in a click, so users won't even notice the onboarding struggle. The project is made with React and Next.js, with the overall intention to keep it simple, cutting down all unnecessary features to focus on just one thing - quick file sharing.

The overall attitude of the project is to be simple to use, both from a user's and a developer's perspective. As a user, you can exchange files, keeping in mind that they could leak or be unavailable in a couple of days, but often that's more than enough. As a developer, you can quickly run Unid and get a local running app that allows you to quickly upload files into Filecoin Storages with a basic, simple interface.

Our tool is focused on UX, and built for one simple, but highly used case - quick file exchange.
